# primes

Simple exercise to print a table of the first 500 primes. Uses **Algorithm P** from "The Art of Computer Programming", Vol. 1, chapter 1.3.2. I wanted to attempt this in Python first to understand how it works before attempting it in 6502 assembly. The number of primes in the table is configurable using the `-n` or `--number` command line option.
