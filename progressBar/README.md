Exercise to animate a progress bar in the terminal. Turns out `\r` can be useful!

Learned that `process.stdout.write` can be used in Node.js to print text to the console without a newline at the end, unlike `console.log`.

Finally, Python has way less overhead than Javascript does for timeouts. I need to experiment more with asynchronous code in Python, but I can say Javascript requiring Promises and async anonymous functions is definitely cumbersome.
