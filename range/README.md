# range

Simple exercise to produce the sequential values in a given range (non-inclusive) using a JavaScript generator function. Implemented in Typescript to be run in node.js.

In a future iteration I might turn this into a module. I mostly wanted to reacquaint myself with basic Typescript.

Exercise comes from [cassidoo's newsletter](https://cassidoo.co/newsletter/), [issue #339](https://buttondown.email/cassidoo/archive/youve-got-to-love-whats-yours-alicia-keys/).

## installation

* Use npm to install the typescript package (unless you have it installed globally)
* Run `npx tsc` (or `tsc` if installed globally) to compile `range.ts` into `range.js`
* Execute program with `node range.js`
